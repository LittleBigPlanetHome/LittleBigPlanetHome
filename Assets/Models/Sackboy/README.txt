Model ripped by Marshivolt/Marshi64! this one took quite awhile to get done.
Now that newer tools have been created, model ripping for the LittleBigPlanet series has gotten a whole lot better!
Features both a DAE export and an FBX export, both contain rigged meshes and Blendshapes (Hopefully?).
Included are all the base textures that Sackboy uses by default in the game, Will be uploading the other skins on Textures Resource.
Also included is a Materials.txt detailing how all the textures included are applied to each material listed.
Hoping this is an improvement over the old rip!
